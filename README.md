# Supporting data for paper, "Effects of Inductor Parasitics on Loop Gain in Single-Ended Common-Drain Colpitts Oscillator"
## By F. Donchevski, Z. Kokolanski, and M. Stankovski

Repository is organized as following:

* **Notes:** contains handwritten notes of derivations regarding characteristic equation, loop gain, root locus, steady-state oscillation condition and frequency.
* **Scripts:** contains Matlab scripts deriving the same expressions as in the handwritten notes, along with root locus plots.
* **Simulations:** contains LTSpice simulations on relevant examples described in the paper
